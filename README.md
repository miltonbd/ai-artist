A collection of projects on various computer vision tasks like classification, segmentation, detection.
The goal is to here unify several model architectures with their practical implementations.

Classification has implementations of:
        <ul>
            <li> RetinaNet </li>
        </ul>

Detection has implementtaion of:


The Applications here are:
          <ul>
            <li> RetinaNet </li>
          </ul>
